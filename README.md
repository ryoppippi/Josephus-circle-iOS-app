# Josephus-circle-iOS-app
Sample app for solving famous problem by swift2

Josephus circle is one of the most famous computer science problem.
I solved this problem during my programming class at my univ. And I really love this problem so I made this app. It is my first time to code in swift2, and I realize how nice the swift language is!
This project taught me how to develop iOS apps and the basic of swift2.

##  Some infomation

I don't know how the auto layout works so this app is only for devices with 4-inch display(iPhone 5,5s, iPod touch 6th gen)
